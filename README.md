## Things I have done on this

-   Cycle animations and custom made components along with styling.
-   Simple NavBar that is reactive when on desktop
-   Responsive design
-   Layout Projects with *fluid* motions
-   Project Cards that expand with a cool animation! 
-   Added a photos page that calls my flickr account to display pictures I have taken. :camera:
